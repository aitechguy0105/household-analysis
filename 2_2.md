To effectively address the challenge of deduplicating beneficiary data from various digital platforms and actors, you can recommend the adoption of the following analytics techniques:

1. **Probabilistic Record Linkage:**
   - Probabilistic record linkage is a powerful technique that uses statistical models to identify and merge duplicate records based on similarities in data attributes.
   - This approach assigns weights to matching criteria such as name, date of birth, address, and other identifiers to calculate the likelihood of two records referring to the same individual.
   - By setting a threshold for similarity scores, probabilistic record linkage can accurately identify and merge duplicate identities in the beneficiary dataset.

2. **Fuzzy Matching:**
   - Fuzzy matching is another effective technique for deduplicating beneficiary data, especially when dealing with variations or errors in data entry.
   - This approach uses algorithms to compare strings and identify similarities between records, even in cases where there are misspellings, abbreviations, or variations in names or other attributes.
   - By applying fuzzy matching algorithms such as Levenshtein distance or Jaro-Winkler similarity, duplicate identities can be detected and resolved based on a defined similarity threshold.

**Additional:**
- **Data Quality Issues:** Address the challenges related to data quality that may impact deduplication efforts, such as incomplete or inconsistent data, missing values, or data entry errors. Implement data cleaning and standardization processes to improve data quality before deduplication.
- **Non-Latin Characters:** Acknowledge the complexities of deduplicating datasets with non-Latin characters, as matching and comparing such characters require special handling due to variations in encoding and representation. Utilize techniques that support multilingual data processing to ensure accurate deduplication results.

By recommending probabilistic record linkage and fuzzy matching as deduplication techniques, along with addressing data quality issues and datasets with non-Latin characters, you can provide a comprehensive and pragmatic approach to resolving duplicate identity challenges in beneficiary data.
